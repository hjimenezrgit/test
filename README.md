# HÃ©ctor Jimenez

Hello, thank you very much for the opportunity to present my evaluation,

The following activities were completed

1. Dockerize services
2. IQ/CD
3. DEPLOYMENT
4. EXTRA POINTS

Inside the REPO, there is the modified python file, as well as the necessary deploy files, to fulfill the additional objective, the deploy requires an NFS service, I include the configuration file of the additional service that was used for the tests.

Modifying the python-arkon/templates/deployment.yaml file is required to specify the NFS service.

## Deployment folder
python-arkon
## NFS folder 
nfs-service
